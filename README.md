## Theory of color


Since the early history of art, people have been making colors that reflect not only the real object in the art but also the idea of the artist.
Leonardo Davinchi used yellow and blue to paint the shadows, which was a very innovative way of painting.  
He did [notes](https://www.discoveringdavinci.com/theory-of-color) about the theory of color.
Since then impressionists changed the way colors were used. Pop-up artists made useful artificial electric colors. Andy Warhol discovered how color affects people's emotions with the perspective of attracting new customers. 
Some artists were trying to figure out the principles of composing the colors for people not so talented in it.
Johannes Itten in his book «The Elements of Colour» described color wheel and color contrasts by analyzing the colors in the art of different cultures.
Nowadays this color wheel is a standard color combination for many designers.

Also well-known but not so widespread on the web are color patterns made by Sanzo Wada.
Based on his book "A dictionary of color combinations" this website is a picker of color combinations, made by Sanzo Wada and his analysis of Japanese art.

## Japan Standard Color Association


Sanzo Wada  (和田 三造, Wada Sanzō, 3 March 1883 – 22 August 1967) is a Japanese artist that made a great influence on the Theory of color filling it with Japanese culture code.
In 1945, he reorganized the Japan Standard Color Association into the Japan Color Research Institute and became its chairman.
In 1951, he completed Japan's first comprehensive standard color chart, "Color Standards."

Between 1933 and 1934, Sanzo Wada published 6-volumes of color studies called Haishoku Soukan (配色辞典), documenting over a thousand color combinations.
The books were intended to capture traditional Japanese perceptions of color, which differed from Western approaches, and included a wide range of subtle shades and hues.

In 2011, Seigensha published A Dictionary of Color Combinations, a book based on Wada’s original 6-volume work, containing 348 color combinations.

## The idea


This project I have been making during education Formación Profesional Grado Superior Desarrollo aplicaciones web in Spain.
I have plans to add more information on color combinations in Spanish art. But the first step is to learn how to do websites.
